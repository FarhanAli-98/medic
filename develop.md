## Work Flow:

1. Create single screen at a time with full functionality untill all screens are developed.

> Example: Create a login screen with full functionality with models, controllers, views.
> When all the functionality is done of the login screen then move on to another screen.

## __Note__:
Add navigation only after all of the screens are created to have a better navigational flow.
Add `TODOs` for marking navigational functions.
